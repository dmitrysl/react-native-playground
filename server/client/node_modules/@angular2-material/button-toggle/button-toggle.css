/**
 * A collection of mixins and CSS classes that can be used to apply elevation to a material
 * element.
 * See: https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/elevation-shadows.html
 * Examples:
 *
 *
 * .md-foo {
 *   @include $md-elevation(2);
 *
 *   &:active {
 *     @include $md-elevation(8);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * <div id="external-card" class="md-elevation-z2"><p>Some content</p></div>
 *
 * For an explanation of the design behind how elevation is implemented, see the design doc at
 * https://goo.gl/Kq0k9Z.
 */
/**
 * The css property used for elevation. In most cases this should not be changed. It is exposed
 * as a variable for abstraction / easy use when needing to reference the property directly, for
 * example in a will-change rule.
 */
/** The default duration value for elevation transitions. */
/** The default easing value for elevation transitions. */
/**
 * Applies the correct css rules to an element to give it the elevation specified by $zValue.
 * The $zValue must be between 0 and 24.
 */
/**
 * Returns a string that can be used as the value for a transition property for elevation.
 * Calling this function directly is useful in situations where a component needs to transition
 * more than one property.
 *
 * .foo {
 *   transition: md-elevation-transition-property-value(), opacity 100ms ease;
 *   will-change: $md-elevation-property, opacity;
 * }
 */
/**
 * Applies the correct css rules needed to have an element transition between elevations.
 * This mixin should be applied to elements whose elevation values will change depending on their
 * context (e.g. when active or disabled).
 */
/**
 * Mixin that creates a new stacking context.
 * see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context
 */
/**
 * This mixin hides an element visually.
 * That means it's still accessible for screen-readers but not visible in view.
 */
/**
 * Forces an element to grow to fit floated contents; used as as an alternative to
 * `overflow: hidden;` because it doesn't cut off contents.
 */
/**
 * A mixin, which generates temporary ink ripple on a given component.
 * When $bindToParent is set to true, it will check for the focused class on the same selector as you included
 * that mixin.
 * It is also possible to specify the color palette of the temporary ripple. By default it uses the
 * accent palette for its background.
